Reupload of Citra that i made months ago but forgot to unprivate. This mirror was forked from [PabloMK7's Fork](https://github.com/PabloMK7/citra) with all of his commits except for the updates to gitmodules (rquired for building) reverted. I have no clue if it'll build now, since the dependencies listed in gitmodules have since been updated, i'm really just making this public to push my copy of Citra's wiki for my friends to use
